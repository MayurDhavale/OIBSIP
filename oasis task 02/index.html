            <b> Bjarne Stroustrup</b> as we popularly know him as the <b>“Father of C++ programming language”</b>, Biography
            Bjarne Stroustrup was born in Aarhus, Denmark in 1950. He graduated from the University of Aarhus in 1975 with a cand. scient.
             (masters) degree in mathematics and computer science and received his Ph.D. in computer science from Cambridge University, England in 1979. 
             After graduation, Dr. Stroustrup joined Bell Labs’ Computer Science Research Center in Murray Hill, New jersey. Staying with AT&T through the various breakups, 
             Dr. Stroustrup was the head of AT&T Labs’ Large-Scale Programming Research Department from 1995 until late 2002. He is now the College of Engineering Chair Professor in Computer Science at Texas A&M University,
              and retains a link with AT&T Labs – Research as a member of the Information and Systems Software Research Lab.

        <p>
            Dr. Stroustrup designed and implemented C++. Over the last decade, C++ has become the most widely used language supporting object-oriented programming by making abstraction techniques affordable and manageable for mainstream projects. 
            Using C++ as his tool, Dr. Stroustrup has pioneered the use of object-oriented and generic programming techniques in application areas where efficiency is a premium; examples include general systems programming, switching, simulation, 
            graphics, user-interfaces, embedded systems, and scientific computation. The influence of C++ and the ideas it popularized are clearly visible far beyond the C++ community. Languages including C, C#, Java, and Fortran99 provide features pioneered for mainstream use by C++,
             as do systems such as COM and CORBA.
